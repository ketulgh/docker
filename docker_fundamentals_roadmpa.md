Learning Docker is indeed a fundamental step towards understanding Kubernetes, as Kubernetes orchestrates containerized applications, and Docker is the most popular containerization platform. Here's a roadmap to gain enough Docker knowledge to move on to Kubernetes comfortably:

### Docker Roadmap for Kubernetes

1. **Understand Containerization:**
   - What are containers and why are they used?
   - Differences between virtual machines and containers.
   - The concept of containerization and its benefits.

2. **Install Docker:**
   - Set up Docker on your local machine (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
   - Understand Docker daemon, Docker client, and Docker registries.

3. **Docker Basics:**
   - Learn Docker commands (`docker run`, `docker build`, `docker images`, `docker ps`, etc.).
   - Understand Docker images and containers.
   - Pulling images from Docker Hub.
   - Running containers from images.

4. **Dockerfiles:**
   - Writing Dockerfiles to create custom images.
   - Understanding layers in Docker images.
   - Best practices for writing Dockerfiles.

5. **Docker Networking:**
   - Concepts of Docker networking.
   - Port mapping and linking containers.
   - Docker network drivers and how to create networks.

6. **Docker Volumes:**
   - Persistent storage with Docker volumes.
   - Bind mounts and their use cases.
   - Volume sharing between containers.

7. **Docker Compose:**
   - Introduction to Docker Compose.
   - Writing `docker-compose.yml` files.
   - Managing multi-container applications with Docker Compose.

8. **Docker Registries:**
   - Using Docker Hub and other registries.
   - Pushing and pulling images.
   - Setting up a private registry if necessary.

9. **Docker Best Practices:**
   - Container orchestration concepts.
   - Stateless vs stateful applications.
   - Immutable infrastructure principles.

10. **Basic Troubleshooting:**
    - Debugging containerized applications.
    - Accessing logs and using `docker exec` to interact with containers.

11. **Security Basics:**
    - Understanding container security.
    - Best practices for securing Docker containers and images.

12. **Introduction to Orchestration:**
    - Why orchestration is needed.
    - Basic concepts of orchestration with a focus on Kubernetes.
